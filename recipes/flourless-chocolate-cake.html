        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
          <li>½ cup water</li>
          <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>18 (1 ounce) squares bittersweet chocolate</li>
          <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
          <li>6 large eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150
            degrees C). Grease a 10-inch round cake pan; set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine sugar, water, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat.
            Stir until completely dissolved; set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Melt bittersweet chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl
            in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3
            minutes. Pour chocolate into the bowl of an electric mixer.
          </li>
          <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions</li>
          <li>
            Cut butter into pieces; beat butter, one piece at a time, into
            chocolate until combined.
          </li>
          <li>Beat in hot sugar water. Slowly beat in eggs, one at a time.</li>
          <li>Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.</li>
          <li>
            Have a pan larger than the cake pan ready; put the cake pan in the
            larger pan and fill the larger pan with boiling water halfway up the
            sides of the cake pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake cake in the water bath in the preheated oven for 45 minutes.
            The center will still look wet. Place cake in the refrigerator until
            thoroughly chilled, 8 hours to overnight.
          </li>
          <li>
            To unmold, dip the bottom of the cake pan in hot water for 10
            seconds and invert onto a serving plate.
          </li>
          <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
