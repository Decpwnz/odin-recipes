    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A rack of lamb is topped with a herby crust before it's roasted. I have
      been using this recipe for a long time, and always enjoy making it. You
      can also do the same thing with beef or pork.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup fresh bread crumbs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 (7 bone) rack of lamb, trimmed and frenched</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees
        C). Move the oven rack to the center position.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine bread crumbs, garlic, rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4
        teaspoon pepper in a small bowl; stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil to
        moisten the mixture. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season rack of lamb all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large heavy oven-proof skillet over
        high heat. Add lamb and sear on all sides, about 1 to 2 minutes: set
        lamb aside for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush lamb with mustard and roll in bread crumb mixture until evenly
        coated. Cover the ends of the bones with foil to prevent charring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange the breaded rack of lamb bone-side down in the same skillet.
        Roast in preheated oven for 12 to 18 minutes for medium; an instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F
        (54 degrees C), or continue to cook to desired doneness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove lamb from the skillet and allow to rest for 5 to 7 minutes,
        loosely covered with foil, before carving between the ribs.
      </li>
    </ol>
